Description This module is a plugin that lets you use netronics&amp;rsquo; can adapters (namely the CANdo and CANdoISO devices) in python-can&amp;rsquo;s plugin interface.
Installation You should have installed the netronics&amp;rsquo; CANdo drivers before using this library; otherwise you will get a DLL error (or, under linux, a shared library error).
pip install python-can-cando Usage Just like any other python-can plugin, you can access the class like so:</description></item><item><title>Convolutional networks, CIFAR-10 and complexity</title><link>https://www.riccardobelli.it/projects/cnn-cifar10-compl/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 15:38:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.riccardobelli.it/projects/cnn-cifar10-compl/</guid><description>Note: this article is also available in Italian as a pdf file.

This means that, unlike many other tasks classics of computer vision, we need only this information; we won&amp;rsquo;t have to tell where the object is in the image with a bounding box or define membership classes pixel by pixel.</description></item><item><title>MISRA-C friendly C99 static assert macro</title><link>https://www.riccardobelli.it/blog/static_assert_misra/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 15:37:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.riccardobelli.it/blog/static_assert_misra/</guid><description>&amp;hellip;and a little extra! ⚠️ If you already know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about and you just want the macro, you can directly jump to the conclusions.
Oftentimes, especially in embedded programming, there are some checks that are better run at compile time rather than at runtime. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have a codebase (for example a library) that has some functionality that relies on the platform&amp;rsquo;s unsigned int to be exactly 4 bytes, or a long to be exactly 8, or the char type to be signed, and so on.</description></item></channel></rss>
